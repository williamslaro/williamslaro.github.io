The Seki-Williams dataset updates Woldendorp, Keman and Budge's (2000) Party Government dataset through 2014. This page describes the various datasets, supporting materials and Stata files necessary for creating datsets with a variety of units of analysis. All files are available through [Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0UNUAM).
