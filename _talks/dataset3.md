Sophia: the Party Perceptions Data is a joint project with [David Fortunato](https://gps.ucsd.edu/faculty-directory/david-fortunato.html){:target="_blank"} and [Thiago Silva](https://thiagosilvaphd.com/){:target="_blank"} that provides aggregate-level estimates of voters' perceptions of parties' placements in advanced democracies in the post-WWII era.  In addition to providing measures of central tendency (such as mean and median) we provide estimates for archetypes (i.e., Jack, Jurgen and Sophia) with common sets of demographic traits, all with appropriate measures of uncertainty.
