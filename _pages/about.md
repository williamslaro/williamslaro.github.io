I am the Frederick A. Middlebush Chair of Political Science in the [Truman School of Government and Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu) at the University of Missouri. I hold a Ph.D. in political science from [Texas A&M University](https://bush.tamu.edu) (2008).  My substantive research interests center on electoral accountability, public opinion and party competition.  My methodological research interests center on spatial econometrics, time series, and interpretation practices.  My work has been published in the *American Journal of Political Science*, *Journal of Politics*, *Political Analysis*, and *Political Science Research and Methods*, among other journals. 

I enjoy watching my three sons play baseball, basketball, football and soccer with my wife, Amanda.
