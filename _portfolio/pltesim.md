[Christopher Gandrud](https://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/p/biocontact.html) and I develop an R package called *pltesim* to generate probabilistic long-term effects for models of binary outcomes with temporal dependence controls (such as cubic splines or polynomials).

## Download Instructions
* To download *pltesim* install the latest development version with the *devtools* package type `devtools::install_github("christophergandrud/pltesim")`
