## The Economic Roots of Cross-National Similarity in Voter Preferences
*(with <a href="http://www.davidfortunato.com" target="_blank">David Fortunato</a> & <a href="https://williamslaro.github.io" target="_blank">Laron K. Williams</a>)*<br>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;"><font size=3><p style="line-height: 1.2;" align="justify" class="hyphens">Anecdotal evidence and recent empirical research suggest that parties observe the strategies of international counterparts when crafting their campaign messages—a process assuming that (changes in) voter preferences are cross-nationally linked. However, the extent to which voter preferences are correlated, and why they may be correlated, remains contested. We propose a theory that identifies globalization, or, international connectedness, as the principal driver of the observed similarity in voters’ ideological preferences across national borders. Specifically, globalization leads to an increase in economic and political integration. As economic shocks are increasingly shared across borders, so too are voters’ responses to them. Using data on the preferences of voters in 30 European democracies from 1976 to 2022, we find greater preference congruence among countries with similar economic structures and unifying political economic institutions. These findings bear important implications for the study of parties and broaden our understanding of the consequences of globalization.
