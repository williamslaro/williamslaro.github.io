## The Science-Natural Resource Policy Relationship: How Aspects of Diffusion Theory Explain Data Selection for Making Biodiversity Management Decisions

**Politics & Policy**, 2013

*(with John David Gerlach and Colleen E. Forcina)*

> This study extends a previous project which examined the salience of neo-institutional theory in explaining how data are selected for use in making and implementing biodiversity management decisions. Our prior findings prompted us to examine the selection of data from federal, state or local, and nongovernmental sources using aspects of diffusion theory. We argue that diffusion theory also possesses explanatory value regarding the identification and selection of data within a natural resource agency. We empirically test our theory by analyzing original data collected from a 2007 survey of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service field offices. We find that drivers of diffusion identified by previous research are explanatory of how data are selected. Specifically, perceptions of other field officesâ€™ data selection procedures and collaboration with interest or advocacy groups aid in explaining field office data selection. The results enhance our understanding of the science-natural resource policy relationship.
