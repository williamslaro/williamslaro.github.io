## Problem Importance across Time and Space: Updating the 'Most Important Problem' Dataset

*(with T. Murat Yildirim)*

**Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties**, forthcoming

> This article introduces the second release of the Most Important Problem Dataset (MIPD) – a publicly available dataset that codes all available responses to the most important problem question in American public opinion. In the article, we first describe a number of innovations in the new release of the dataset and then demonstrate its usefulness through illustrative cases. In the new MIPD, we switch from providing a single code for the entire response to the various quasi-responses contained in the response, added information on the state in which the interview took place, and subcategories that include – when relevant – information on the preferred levels of policy. These improvements allow for more fine-grained categories and facilitate more accurate inferences at the individual- and aggregate-level. We also extended the time frame through 2020. The new MIPD codes responses from over 850 surveys of more than a million Americans from 1939–2020 into 110 issue categories.
