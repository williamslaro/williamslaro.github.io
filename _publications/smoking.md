## North American Public Opinion on Health and Smoking

*(with Raymond M. Duch and Kent L. Tedin)*

**Public Opinion Quarterly**, 2018

> Public opinion regarding smoking and health has been of interest to polling companies since the 1940s. This article documents the rate of change in the publicâ€™s awareness and beliefs about smoking and health in North America (the United States and Canada). It reports on four broad categories of opinions: public awareness of reports that smoking has been linked to lung cancer; beliefs that smoking is harmful to health and a cause of lung cancer; beliefs that smoking is a cause of diseases other than lung cancer; and beliefs about the health hazards of secondhand smoke.
