## X Marks the Spot: Unlocking the Treasure of Spatial-X Models

*(with Cameron Wimpy and Guy D. Whitten)*

**The Journal of Politics**, 2021

> In recent years, political scientists have made extensive use of spatial econometric models to test a wide range of theories.
In a review of spatial papers, we find that amajority of these studies use the spatial autoregressive (SAR)model. Although
this is a powerfulmethod that reveals inferences about diffusion processes, it is also highly restrictive and makes assumptions
that often are not appropriate given the expressed theories.We contend that spatial-X (SLX) models are a better reflection of
typical theories about spatial processes. Our simulations demonstrate that SLX models consistently retrieve the direct and
indirect effects of covariates when the true data-generating process reflects other spatial processes. SARmodels, however, tend
to find phantom higher-order effects that are not present in the data. We further demonstrate how SLX models reveal
heterogeneity in patterns of spatial dependence in countriesâ€™ defense burdens that SAR models cannot discover.
